		<p>This was a very powerful influence of my sister's life. When she arrived, she was a mess..coherent only half the time and difficult to talk to. Drug and alcohol addiction had destroyed her life, and any semblance of normalcy was pretty much out the window. We didn't know where else to turn. A friend of mine, who had similar struggles with addiction had recommended it to us. Having had little experience in this area, I wanted to send my sister to a place that had been a positive experience for someone I actually knew. After spending nearly three months in treatment, she left the treatment center with a renewed sense of purpose, with the support of her family and an amazing post-care support system. She shared with me some of her experiences while in treatment and how she was given proper guidance from staff on how to stay close to the people and places that were positive influences that would help keep her sober. She has since been attending weekly meetings with others and events that she claims have kept her sober during times where she worried about relapsing. This isn't just a treatment center, it's a place where people can have a chance to get their life back....where they can gain control and get on top of the triggers that have been ruining their lives. Thank you! You are a Godsend! I would recommend this facility to anyone struggling with addiction.</p>

			<h1>Do I Need Treatment?</h1>
			<hr>
			<p>People with addictions also need to change how they do things so they can live healthy lives again without drugs. But getting the drug out of a person’s system is just the first stage of treatment.</p>
			<p><strong>They did not care for their family, their work, or their community.</strong>&nbsp;People with addictions often are in a lot of trouble for breaking rules and not keeping their promises.<br>
<strong>They did not look after their health.</strong>&nbsp;People with addictions might not be eating or sleeping well, cleaning their teeth, or getting treated for infections. Their drug use might have caused health problems.<br>
<strong>Things they used to enjoy no longer make them feel good.</strong>&nbsp;When people are on drugs, they stop caring about hobbies, interests, and friends.</p>
	<p>Talking with doctors or counselors (people trained to listen and help you solve personal problems) or other people in treatment can help.</p>
	<p><strong>We are available 24/7. Call to speak with a Treatment Specialist and find the help you need.</strong></p>

4.3	Because an industry-standard Do-Not-Track protocol has not yet been established, our information collection practices will continue to operate as described in this Privacy Policy regardless of any “Do Not Track” signals that may be sent by certain browsers or selected by you.

WE AND THOSE PURCHASING A LEAD FROM US, ARE NOT LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF YOUR USE OF THE WEBSITE OR ANY OF THE INFORMATION, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OF THE WEBSITE.</p>  
 
<p>YOU AND WE AGREE TO RESOLVE DISPUTES ONLY BY FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION as follows:</p> 
 
<p>A.     ANY DISPUTE THAT IN ANY WAY RELATES TO OR ARISES OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR FROM ANY OTHER AGREEMENT BETWEEN US, OR SERVICES OR BENEFITS YOU RECEIVE OR CLAIM TO BE OWED FROM US, WILL BE RESOLVED BY FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION BY ONE OR MORE ARBITRATORS BEFORE THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION (“AAA”), OR ANOTHER ARBITRATION ADMINISTRATOR THAT WE MUTUALLY AGREE UPON. Arbitration will apply not only to claims against us, but also claims against the officers, directors, managers, employees, agents, affiliates, insurers, contractors, successors or assigns of us, as well as the administrator, service agreement administrator, issuer or provider. Arbitration and this paragraph shall apply to claims that arose at any time, including claims arising before this paragraph became binding on the parties. The federal arbitration act (9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.) and not any state law applies to this arbitration agreement.</p>
 
<p>B.      For claims of $10,000 or less, the party bringing the claim can choose the AAA’s rules for binding arbitration or, alternatively, can bring an individual action in small claims court.</p>
 
<p>C.      YOU GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.  This means that you may not be a representative or member of any class of claimants or act as a private attorney general in court or in arbitration with respect to any claim. Notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement, the arbitrator shall not have the power to determine that class arbitration is permissible. The arbitrator also shall not have the power to preside over class or collective arbitration, or to award any form of class-wide or collective remedy. Instead, the arbitrator shall have power to award money or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. No class or representative or private attorney general theories of liability or prayers for relief may be maintained in any arbitration held under this agreement. </p>
 
<p>D.     If for some reason the prohibition on class arbitrations set forth in Subsection C cannot be enforced, then the agreement to arbitrate will not apply. </p>
 
<p>E.      IF FOR ANY REASON A CLAIM PROCEEDS IN COURT RATHER THAN THROUGH ARBITRATION, YOU AND WE AGREE THAT THERE WILL NOT BE A JURY TRIAL. </p>
 
<p>YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU EXPRESSLY ASSENT TO THE TERMS HEREOF. </p>
